# Hatchery  

Hatchery is a no-code tool for creating your own [WebFishing](https://webfishing.pro) [GDWeave](https://github.com/NotNite/GDWeave) mods!  
Currently a [Python](https://www.python.org) script, this project is in early development and will change forms eventually, likely an executable file made with Godot.  
Check out [Fishing Expanded](https://github.com/coolbot100s/FishingExpanded), for an example of a project created with Hatchery!  

## What can Hatchery do?

- Create functional mod files from a simple spreadsheet, no coding necessary.
- Create mods from the command line by answering a few questions about your mod (coming soon™️)
- Generate mod file templates including scenes and scripts.  
- Generate asset templates to avoid misnamed assets and godot project corruption.  
- Create a build folder and manifest file automagically, so you can zip and ship!

### New Fish

Thanks to [Lure](https://github.com/Sulayre/WebfishingLure), adding new fish to the game is already pretty simple, with Hatchery you can add the data you want for your fish to a spreadsheet and have as many as you want created all at once!  
Note that the example `input.csv` already filters out the data you probably don't want to modify, but if you want to make your fish even more exciting, simply add a collumn for the relevant data, Hatchery will handle the rest.  
Having trouble balancing your fish? Check out [this data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N-uiVKMLc4itN2enzeXCH6WJ9eEUbmoc2P0GV3Dqm2k/) for easy reference!

### Mod files

Hatchery will generate the structure and manifest files for your mod, you just have to answer a few questions, or fill out the example modinfo.json.  

## What can Hatchery not do?  

Hatchery can not make your art for you, that's where you come in!  
Hatchery can not export your mod's `.pck` for you, see below for more info.  


## How do I use Hatchery?

Simply download or clone this repository, and run `Hatchery.py`, your terminal will guide you through the rest.  
If you want to use a `.csv` file to create fish in bulk, you can edit the one provided, same for generating your mod's info from a `.json`  

### Okay, now what?  
I'll write up some more guidance on the quickest and easiest (if not the best) way to export your mod soon:tm:  
For now, check out [Blueberry's Guide](https://github.com/BlueberryWolf/WEBFISHINGModdingGuide), once you have a project set up correctly, you can add the files or drag and drop the entire mods folder generated by Hatchery and then export.  
Once you have a `.pck` file, put that in the generated build folder and you're good to go!
