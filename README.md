# Hatchery  

Hatchery is a no-code tool for creating your own [WebFishing](https://webfishing.pro) [GDWeave](https://github.com/NotNite/GDWeave) mods!  
Currently a Python script, this project is in early development and will likely change forms eventually, likely a executable file made with GoDot.  
Check out [FishingExpanded](https://github.com/coolbot100s/FishingExpanded), for an example of a project created with Hatchery!

## What can Hatchery do?

- Create functional mod files from a simple spreadsheet, no coding necessary.
- Create mods from the command line by answering a few questions about your mod (coming soon™️)
- Generate mod file templates including scenes and scripts.  
- Generate asset templates to avoid misnamed assets and godot project corruption.  
- Create a build folder and manifest file automagically, so you can zip and ship!

### New Fish

Thanks to [Lure](https://github.com/Sulayre/WebfishingLure), adding new fish to the game is already pretty simple, with Hatchery you can add the data you want for your fish to a spreadsheet and have as many as you want created all at once!  
Note that the example `input.csv` already filters out the data you probably don't want to modify, but if you want to make your fish even more exciting, simply add a collumn for the relavent data, Hatchery will handle the rest.  

### Mod files

Hatchery will generate the structure and manifest files for your mod, you just have to answer a few questions, or fill out the example modinfo.json.  

## What can Hatchery not do?  

Hatchery can not export your mod for you, make sure to follow the instructions provided by GDWeave.
